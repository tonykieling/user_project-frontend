v2ish (next deliveries):
user's levels:
 1- may create account, login and change its own data (name, email and password)
 2- may create account, login and change its own data (name, email and password) + change others users data
 3- may create account, login and change its own data (name, email and password) + check logs
 4- may create account, login and change its own data (name, email and password) + change others users data + check logs
* it needs to create a new table, maybe called as userslevel

9- table event correlates rather than the whole event name in logs table



1- pictures and files record/load (fs)
2- deploy front and back (file structure and how does react and node is gonna work?) (?webpack, bundler)
3- 
4 - why all click pages reload the entire app?
